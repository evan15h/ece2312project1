MATLAB code for Project 1 of ECE 2312 Discrete-Time Signal and System Analysis at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, Worcester, MA.

ECE_2312_Project1 is the script utilized to create .wav files. In this case, the three phrases given in the project were created with this script.
ECE_2312_Project1_Waveforms is the script that materizalized a frequency and spectrogram plot for each phrase.
ECE_2312_Project1_Fun is the script used to perform time delay and attenuation of the right column vector after converting the mono-recorded phrases into stereo audio.


To correctly utilize the code, download the .wav phrase files in the github and run the 'Waveforms' script for the frequency plots and spectrograms. Then, with the stored variables, run the 'Fun' script to create .wav files for the delayed and attenuated audio files.
